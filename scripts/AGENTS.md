# scripts AGENTS

## Purpose
Repository quality + smoke-entry commands.

## What exists now
- `check.sh` — full gate (fix/fmt/vet/tests/race + smoke).
- `smoke.sh` — runs basic example against local `pi` CLI.

## What is missing
- Optional perf/benchmark gate (if needed later).

## Owned files
- `check.sh`
- `smoke.sh`

## Canonical commands
- `./scripts/check.sh`
- `./scripts/smoke.sh`
