# internal AGENTS

## Purpose
Private implementation packages for test/runtime support.

## What exists now
- `testsupport/` — hermetic fake-pi helper runtime used by e2e tests.

## What is missing
- Additional private runtime packages (only if core package split is justified).

## Canonical commands
- `go test ./...`
